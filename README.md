Use:
The Cutlog worksheet contains the primary tool. The cells are arranged in the order that details might come up inside a call. Every call would need to fill in the first row to comply with HIPAA. On the second row, the user would specify the type of call then the details pertinent to that kind of activity. The Notes section is an actual place to take notes that don't need to be logged. Requesting and Advised are sections for writing plain English should it be needed. The red Closed and Open sections fill with the output to be pasted into the particular application that needs the log. Open versus Closed relates to whether or not the issue had been resolved. Click the clear button to ready the worksheet for a new call. 

The multilog worksheet is used in case a caller has multiple inquiries to make for multiple users with mostly similar functions to a single log, but on a row by row basis. 

The Reference sheet fills with information from cutlog mostly and is layed out with each call type on each row. The green sections are to help direct users back to the functional parts of the tool if they are not used to working in Excel.
